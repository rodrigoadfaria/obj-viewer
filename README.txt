README
------
  OBJ viewer is a web tool capable of load and render a 3D object defined by a modelling tool such as
  Blender, Maya, and others. Find out how to use this tool in the man section of this file.

CONFIG
------
  You do not need any previous configuration to run the application, just use a web browser that supports
  HTML5 canvas and WebGL technology.
  The only thing you need is to look for .obj files or create them using a modelling tool like those
  mentioned in the previous section. In the 'sample_obj' directory, you can find a sample .obj file.

MAN
---
  Just open the 'objViewer.html' page in your preferred web browser and enjoy it! We have detailed aspects
  regarding the features above:
  
  [Load OBJ file...] read a .obj file with the description of faces, vertices, normals and object name.
  Some commands such as 'mtllib', 'usemtl', are not being read.
  
  [Shader Vertex/Fragment] toggle between two different shaders. This option stop the current vertex/fragment shaders
  and load a new one with different shading algorithm.
  
  [Mesh Flat/Smooth] toggle the method of shading from flat to smooth and vice versa.
  
  [Draw Triangles/Lines] toggle the method of drawing from triangles to line strip and vice versa.
  
  [Rotation] rotate the scene by holding the left click and dragging to any direction.
  
  [Zoom in/out] zoom in/out the scene by rolling the mouse wheel or by holding the right click and 
  dragging to any direction.

NOTICE
------
  We have tested only in Microsoft Internet Explorer v11.0.9600 and Google Chrome v41.0.2272.118.
  If you have a web browser that supports the HTML5 canvas and WebGL technology, you will get it working.
  
  You can see detailed information of the functions in the javascript files.
